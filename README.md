# snake-and-ladders
ok so from where do i begin . 
<br> 
Lets take it slow and start by telling aboutpositions of snakes and ladders in this code 
<br>
head of snakes=[12,36,89,98,77]
<br>tail of snake=[1,10,42,9,24]
<br>
tail_of_ladder=[88,7,47,87,3]
<br>head_of_ladder=[91,99,92,90,71]
<br>
I have imagined a 10x10 board with index of each row and column from 0 to 9 (lmao habbit of coders to start from 0) and position is a two digit number with 10th digit as column  and oneth digit as row . so the board goes from 0 to 99. 
<br>
i have placed intial positions of pieces as -1 so negative number shows boundness ( in science also!!!!!) and above 98 is considered a win . 
<br>
At first your piece is bounded aka locked and to unlock it you requires to get a 6 . 
<br>
Each 6 gives extra turn but the first 6 to unlock is consumed to unlock it 
<br>
This was actually a college assignment but i thought that this is too good to not put in my repo and so i did. 
<br>
And at last chapoo . so basically our college has a culture of calling treat given from a senior to junior as chappoo . so i added it for  a nice reference . 
<br> 
Btw our proff also added chappo in the winning sentence . so in some way to give him credit and respect i didn't change the winning sentence . 
Thank you for coming this far
